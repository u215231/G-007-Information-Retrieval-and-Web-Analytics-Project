# Information Retrieval and Web Analytics Project Summary

## Summary

Based on what you learned from theoretical classes, the seminars, the lab exercises, and your own research, you are asked to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system based on a custom search engine implementing different indexing and ranking algorithms.

You are asked to implement four incremental steps that must be delivered on predefined dates:

| Part   | Topic                                         | Delivery Date       |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|:----------------|
| Part 1 | Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis | Friday 24/10/2025   |
| Part 2 | Indexing and Evaluation                       | Friday 31/10/2025   |
| Part 3 | Ranking and Filtering                         | Thursday 20/11/2025 |
| Part 4 | RAG, User Interface, and Web Analytics        | Saturday 29/11/2025 |

The requirements definitions for each part will be published in the Aula Global in the corresponding week. The programming language must be Python3. Create a GitHub repository to upload and share your code.

## Project deliverables

You must deliver for each of the parts the following artifacts:

1.  A PDF report, uploaded to Aula Global in a section that will be available for that purpose. Name the report file like IRWA-2025-uXXXXXX-uXXXXXX-uXXXXXX-part-N.pdf where uXXXXXX is each student's ID. The report must include: an explanation of the decisions you made for implementing the different algorithms, the assumptions made, and everything else you consider relevant to explain to the evaluators.

2.  The repository TAG that names the part that you are delivering, i.e., IRWA-2025-part-N. The TAG creation date must be before the delivery deadline in order to be considered. You can find here a guide on how to work with Git. Section 2.6 addresses tagging.

The deadline time is at 23:00 on the requested date. Delivery late: -20% of the grade per day.

The delivered code must be properly documented (especially the defined functions) and equipped with a proper README file in the project’s root folder. The README should include step-by-step instructions about how to run the code and how to select the different functions, algorithms, and/or other options to run the ranking scores.

Remember to mention the GitHub URL and TAG in the report for each part.
