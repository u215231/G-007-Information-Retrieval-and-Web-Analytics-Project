The GitHub repository with the code of the labs is the following: <https://github.com/u215231/Information-Retrieval-and-Web-Analytics-Project.git>. Here, you have to navigate to the folder where the Part 2 solution is located: `IRWA-2025-part-3`. The Python notebook with the solution's code is called `IRWA-2025-part-3-final-solution.ipynb`.

## Introduction

## Development

<b>
1. You’re asked to provide 3 different ways of ranking: 
- TF-IDF + cosine similarity: Classical scoring, which we have also seen during the 
practical labs <br>
- BM25  <br>
- Your Score: Here, the task is to create a new score. (Be creative, think about what factors could make a document more relevant to a query and include them in your formula.) 

Explain how the ranking differs when using TF-IDF and BM25, and think about the pros and  cons  of  using  each  of  them.  Regarding your own score, justify the choice of the score (pros and cons). HINT: Look into numerical fields that each record has to build your score.

2.  Implement word2vec + cosine ranking score. Return a top-20 list of documents for each of  the  5  queries  defined  in  the  Part  2  of  your  project, using search and word2vec + cosine similarity ranking. 
   
To represent a piece of text using word2vec, we create a single vector that represents the entire text. This vector has the same number of dimensions as the word vectors and is calculated by averaging the vectors of all words in the text.

3. Can you imagine a better representation than word2vec? Justify your answer. 
(HINT - what about Doc2vec? Sentence2vec? What are the pros and cons?)
