## Introductory Section


1.  You’re asked to provide 3 different ways of ranking: 
- TF-IDF + cosine similarity: Classical scoring, which we have also seen during the 
practical labs <br>
- BM25  <br>
- Your Score: Here, the task is to create a new score. (Be creative 🎨, think about 
what factors could make a document more relevant to a query and include them 
in your formula.) 

Explain how the ranking differs when using TF-IDF and BM25, and think about the pros and  cons  of  using  each  of  them.  Regarding your own score, justify the choice of the score (pros and cons). HINT: Look into numerical fields that each record has to build your score.
